# 6502 disassembler

This project was written around 1990, and rescued from a 3.5" floppy disk.

The company I was working for (NeSA B.V.) had had the need to modify the program which was running on
a SBC (Single Board Computer).  
The microprocessor was a 6502 and the program was stored in a PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory).
We knew what the program was doing, but had no sourcecode and only a 6502 assembler (running is DOS).

So, what do do?  Write a 6502 disassembler, using the binary contents of the PROM as the source.
And then based on what we knew it was doing, re-create the sourcecode is such a format that is was
re-usable again.

Please note again, that it is no problem nowadays to find with Google a decenent 6502 disassembler.
But around 1990, the Internet as we know it did not exist, and you had to work with a 9600 or 14k4 modem to dial in into a BBS 
(Bulleting Board System), and use a commandline prompt and search that way.

Anyway, I uploaded this project to Github, so it does not get lost.

Have fun,
Henk
